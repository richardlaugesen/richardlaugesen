I've spent the last decade or so as a computational hydrologist at the Bureau of Meteorology. I get to lead teams of like-minded nerds and feed big datasets into very [fast computers](https://nci.org.au/) to [predict](http://www.bom.gov.au/water/) the future. I think it's the best job in the world.

My wife and I own [Ecoyarns](https://ecoyarns.com.au) where we sell socially responsible yarn and fibre to an awesome crafty community.

In the past I've been a [programmer](/blog/somewhat-successful-software/), high school physics teacher, book author, business owner, research assistant, french polisher, musician, concreter, and electrical laborer.

I relax by playing around on a [guitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Jaguar) and riding my bicycle as much as I can.

I majored in Physics at University, and did a bunch of graduate study.

Focused on focus, minimalist, [INTJ](http://typelogic.com/intj.html), [Haemophilia A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilia_A), interested in machine learning.

Live in Australia, born in New Zealand, married to a Singaporean.

What I'm doing [now](/now).
