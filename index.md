I've spent the last decade or so as a computational hydrologist at the Bureau of Meteorology. I get to lead teams of like-minded nerds and feed big datasets into very [fast computers](https://nci.org.au/) to [predict](http://www.bom.gov.au/water/) the future. I think it's the best job in the world.

My wife and I own [Ecoyarns](https://ecoyarns.com.au) where we sell socially responsible yarn and fibre to an awesome crafty community.

In the past I've been a [programmer](./writing/somewhat-successful-software/), high school physics teacher, book author, business owner, research assistant, french polisher, musician, concreter, and electrical laborer.

I majored in Physics at University, and did a bunch of graduate study. I've forgotten most of what I learnt.

Live in Australia, born in New Zealand, married to a Singaporean.

I enjoy working on [geneology](./gramps)

What I'm doing [now](./now).
