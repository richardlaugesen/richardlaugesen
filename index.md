Seneca once said - it's not that life is short, it's that we waste most of it.

So this is what I do:
 - Entertain my daughters
 - Build [forecast systems](http://www.bom.gov.au/water/) so people can make better decisions about water
 - Help [Ecoyarns](https://ecoyarns.com.au) get people making things from socially responsible yarn
 - Generate business ideas and occasionally [ship them](./writing/somewhat-successful-software/)
 - Learn [Danish and Indonesian](https://duome.eu/tinyrocker) for fun
 - Be healthy

What I'm doing [now](./now).
