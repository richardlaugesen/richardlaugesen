I've spent the last decade as a [computational hydrologist](http://www.bom.gov.au/water) at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. I think it's the best job in the world because I get to pretend I can predict the future.

My wife and I own [Ecoyarns](https://ecoyarns.com.au) where we sell socially responsible yarn and fibre to an awesome crafty community. 

In the past I've been a software developer, high school physics teacher, book author, business owner, research assistant, french polisher, musician, and concreter.

Focused on focus, minimalist, [INTJ](http://typelogic.com/intj.html), [Haemophilia A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilia_A), interested in machine learning.

Live in Australia, born in New Zealand, married to a Singaporean.

What I'm doing [now](/now) and more about [me in 60 seconds](/about).
