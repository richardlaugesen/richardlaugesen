Seneca once said - it's not that life is short, it's that we waste most of it.

Here is how I spend my time:
 - Entertain my daughters
 - Herd scientists to build [forecast systems](http://www.bom.gov.au/water/) so people can make better decisions about water
 - Help [Ecoyarns](https://ecoyarns.com.au) get the world making their own things from socially responsible yarn
 - Generate a stream of business ideas, occasionally [ship them](./writing/somewhat-successful-software/), and very rarely for profit
 - Learn [Danish and Indonesian](https://duome.eu/tinyrocker) for fun

What I'm doing [now](./now).
