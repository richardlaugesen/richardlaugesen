So embarrassing!

Tried to start four fires in the last month and only one has worked. Which makes me think that one was a fluke.

The girls are disappointed and expectations are high.

Turns out that the things you learnt in Scouts 30 years ago don't stick around without practice.

Could it be because the ground was damp?
