I will spare you the backstory but a recent visit to our family doctor resulted in a fantastic education.

Here is what we learnt:

- Paracetamol and Ibuprofen reduce internal body temperature through different mechanisms
- Giving them at the same time is okay and a more effective way to reduce internal temperature than giving them separately
- Current recommendation is to avoid trying to reduce internal temperature, aim for comfort
- High core temperature does not cause seizures or brain damage
- Ibuprofen should be fine with a Factor VIII level around 40, but not 14
- It's common for kids to get secondary bacterial infections after a viral infection but hard to diagnose
- Streptococcal Pharyngitis (strep throat) can kill a child in a few days if not treated
- An effective treatment for strep throat is the antibiotic [Phenoxymethylpenicillin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenoxymethylpenicillin), first used in 1948
- Phenoxymethylpenicillin is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic and therefore does not disrupt gut-flora as much (less active on [gram negative bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-negative_bacteria))

Want to know what is terrifying? A 5 year old with a temperature approaching 40 degrees for a week.

I'm grateful we have a good family doctor.
