I will spare you the backstory but a recent visit to our family doctor resulted in some fantastic education. Here is what we learnt:

- Paracetamol and Ibuprofen reduce body temperature through different mechanisims

- Giving them at the same time is okay and a more effective way to reduce core temperature than giving them seperately

- Current recommendation is to avoid reducing temperature if possible, aim for comfort though

- High core body temperatures do not cause seziures or brain damage

- Streptococcal Pharyngitis (strep throat) can kill a child in a few days if not treated

- An effective treatment for strep throat is the antibiotic [Phenoxymethylpenicillin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenoxymethylpenicillin), first used in 1948

- Phenoxymethylpenicillin is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic and therefore does not distrupt gut biota as much (less active on [gram negative bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-negative_bacteria))

Want to know what is terrifying? A 5 year old with a core temperature of 40 degrees. I'm gratful we have a good family doctor.
