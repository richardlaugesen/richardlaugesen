Answering that opening question in an interview can be terrifying. 

Here is a simple approach to handle it that should only take about 1 minute.

Just tell them:

- Stuff you did in the past that matches what they want in the future
- And a story that demonstrates one of your good qualities

Don't tell them:

- Your life story
- Anything about pets, travel, or hobbies

Writing it down first and practicing till it sounds natural is probably a good idea too.
