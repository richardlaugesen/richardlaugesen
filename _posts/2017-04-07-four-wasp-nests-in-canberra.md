We have four nests under the eves on the porch and all are native Australian wasps.

They shouldn’t be a problem unless in high traffic area (which these are really). I was stung once, it hurt!

They are a gardeners friend because they keep caterpillars under control.

The best advice I've found to remove them is to use a fast knock down insecticide spray after dusk when all adults are back on the nest. Just make sure there is a clear path back to the house so you don't trip. Decided it would be a bit tricky to do this with four nests. I may succeed at killing the wasps on one nest but the wasps on the other three will probably start attacking me!

One is a nest of Roplalidia Plebeiana and the other three nests are Polistes Humilis. Names like that make the wasps sound very clever.

I found this [PDF article](http://www.xcsconsulting.com.au/pdf/Paper_Wasps_of_Canberra.pdf) really useful for identifying the species.

There’s a wasp hotline to call in Canberra on 0261621914. I think they will remove any European Wasps nests free of charge, and give free advice on other species of wasp but not removing the nests.

**Update**: All wasps were gone by the second week of May, and the nests became a great preschool show-and-tell activity.

**Update**: It's early October and the wasps are back, exact same locations as last year. 

**Update**: Three [currawong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currawong) knocked the nest down and ate all teh wasps at 7am on 27th March 2018. It was unusually cold, around 1&deg;C.
