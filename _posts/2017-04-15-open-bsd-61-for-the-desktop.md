OpenBSD v6.1 was released a few days ago and I was got curious - could it be used as an everyday desktop environment?

The install was much better than last time I tried (v5?). Got it to the point of a running Gnome, Firefox, and Emacs fairly quickly. This surprised me because my FreeBSD days are a long way behind me and I'm now a complete beginner. It was very familiar to Linux however.

I used it for a few days as my primary desktop environment. The UI seemed a bit laggy but I'm guessing that was because I was running it in a virtual machine. And in general the experience felt a bit crippled and awkward compared to my Fedora desktop. I guess this is because I just donâ€™t understand it and maybe those feelings would vanish with a bit of experience. The man pages and built in docs were very excellent.

An argument used in favor of using OpenBSD is that it is super secure.

I can almost buy this for a server but as a desktop environment instead of Fedora?

I'm using the same user-space applications in both operating systems and any security flaws in those applications are likely to be patched quicker in Fedora. Those applications are surely the majority of my attack surface. Therefore having a more secure operating system to run these applications on becomes is less important. Or am I missing something?

OpenBSD is also missing a few things which I use pretty regularly - Anaconda, CUDA, Mathematica

This [article](https://allthatiswrong.wordpress.com/2010/01/20/the-insecurity-of-openbsd/) has a similar argument, and has a pretty nasty comment thread.
