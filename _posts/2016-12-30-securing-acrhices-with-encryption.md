I want to archive a directory and then encrypt it. And obviously get that directory back again sometime in future.

This will archive, compress, and encrypt:

```
tar -cz some-directory | gpg -c -o archive.tgz.gpg
```

And this will decrypt, decompress, and extract:

```
gpg -d archive.tgz.gpg | tar xz
```

This uses [symmetric encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm) with an [AES128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) cipher. AES128 is sufficient to protect classified information up to the SECRET level. Good enough for me.
