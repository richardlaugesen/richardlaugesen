Perhaps you are like me, with ideas in various states of completeness rattling around your mind. Some are decades old.

Let’s try writing - an ancient hack to convert that tangle of thoughts into a set of coherent and external chunks. If writing works then I should find myself feeling a little more [tranquil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataraxia).

Publishing will need courage but it will stop me cheating because the social contract should force those thoughts into their clearest form out of respect for the reader. It has to be engaging, relevant, and concise.

In a practical sense that set of published articles will be a convenient external memory to refer back to.

Now, how to write?
