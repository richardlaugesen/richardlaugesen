Compression hydrology

Want to estimate model performance before you start any work?

Use Kolmogorov Complexity.

Compress the observation streamflow time series and check the compression ratio. 

If it is high then there are lots of runs of zero, constant, or missing values. Any rainfall-runoff model will struggle with that.

Verify this with some case studies
