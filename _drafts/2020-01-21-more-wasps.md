We recently moved to a new suburb in Canberra and a wasp nest has sprung up in the courtyard.

Based on my [last experience with wasps](./writing/four-wasp-nests/) I was worried!

After a bit of research it turns out they are nests from [mud dauber wasps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud_dauber) and nothing to be afraid of. They are solatary rather than social and the mum helps out in the garden by catching and feeding spiders and catalipilers to her babies. They are common in the Australian bush and stings only happen if they feel threatened.

Our new place is closer to the bush so perhaps that has something to do with getting these friendly wasps.
