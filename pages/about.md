I've spent the last decade as a computational hydrologist at the Bureau of Meteorology. I get to lead teams of like-minded geeks to feed big datasets into very [fast computers](https://nci.org.au/) to [predict](http://www.bom.gov.au/water/) the future. I think it's the best job in the world.

My wife and I own [Ecoyarns](https://ecoyarns.com.au) where we sell socially responsible yarn and fibre to an awesome crafty community. 

In the past I've been a software developer, high school physics teacher, book author, business owner, research assistant, french polisher, musician, and concreter.

I once wrote some software for myself to automagically create classroom seating charts based on student relationships. Turned out lots of other teachers also wanted it so I gave it a name (Termites) and sold licences. I lost interest after a few years and closed down the business but it was fun and profitable for a while. 

I wrote a testing platform for schools and universities with [Mitch O'Toole](http://www.newcastle.edu.au/profile/mitch-otoole) called [Think Literacy](https://app.thinkliteracy.com/). It has long since outgrown it's name though. Teachers and researchers create tests and surveys, students complete them, the software marks the test and identifies difficulties, the students get worksheets targeting their difficulties, the teachers get class reports, and the researchers get to study relationships across large student cohorts correlated with survey responses. It's used in 22 institutions by around 13,000 students.

Completed a Science degree with a major in Physics, and a Graduate Diploma of Education. Started two masters degrees but dropped out of both; an MBA, and a masters of IT. Neither were a very good fit and I'm glad I quit.

Focused on focus, minimalist, [INTJ](http://typelogic.com/intj.html), [Haemophilia A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilia_A), interested in machine learning.

Live in Australia, born in New Zealand, married to a Singaporean.
