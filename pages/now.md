More work on my first PhD paper following feedback from co-authors. The feedback shows that I've still got a lot to learn.

At the AMOS 2021 conference this week and am really enjoying the online/virtual format, much less anxiety. Learning about Antarctica and its involvement in climate change is really interesting because it is outside the area I work. And the history session was awesome. 

Plenty of work this month for my Great Barrier Reef role - model runs, technical working groups, deliverables, customer meetings, project planning...

Kids have been back at school and Y is already home with a cold virus in the second week. This culture of sending kids to school when they are 'just a little big sick' is so wrong!
