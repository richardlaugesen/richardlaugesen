(This is a [now](http://nownownow.com/about) page, maybe you should have one too)

Summer in Canberra.

At work after a week off. Sorting out new projects for the coming year, and tying up loose-ends from last year.

Exploring our family history by putting our tree together in [Gramps](https://gramps-project.org) and doing DNA tests.

Writing a water resource modelling library in [Clojure](https://clojure.org) to learn more about both.

Travelling to New Zealand in July, and camping on the South Coast NSW in a few weeks. 

Trying out [Bullet Journalling](http://bulletjournal.com/) again to stay on top of things.

Read [Ego is the enemy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27036528-ego-is-the-enemy) at the end of last year, so good.
