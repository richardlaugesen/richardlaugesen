(This is a [now](http://nownownow.com/about) page, maybe you should have one too)

Finished outline of the first paper for my PhD and have submitted to my supervisors for their comments. I'm really excited about the big idea in the paper and cant wait to get it out there and start talking about it. Still a long way to go though. 

Reviewing a paper for Hydrologic Processes and am really enjoying new stuff. Cant talk about what it is due to the integrity and anonymity of the peer review process. Like democracy, it may be a bit messy and slightly broken but it's the best we have and in the long run seems to work.

Exploring our new local neighbourhood and facilities during the school holidays.

Have taken every Wednesday off work during the kids summer holidays and it has been a suprisingly good bang-for-buck to get quality family time AND work done. Back to school next week though.

Listening to the Indistractable audiobook. Obviously need help since I'm writing this instead of doing the review!
