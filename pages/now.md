(This is a [now](http://nownownow.com/about) page, maybe you should have one too)

Spring in Canberra.

Still spending most of my time on domestic duties, but it feels like we have finally turned the corner and everyone is getting healthier. Influenza is shit.

Attended the mid-winter dinner of my local Haemophilia association. Met some wonderful people and learnt all about the Australian My Health Record. Connected with three seperate people over business ideas, I found that suprising for some reason.

Plans for another business are starting to come together. If it works then I should end up being more useful, have more agency, and more fun. Trying to minimise the downside.
