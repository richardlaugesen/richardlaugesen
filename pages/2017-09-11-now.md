(This is a [now](http://nownownow.com/about) page, maybe you should have one too)

It is Spring and I'm home in Canberra.

In family recovery mode after my trip to the Whitsundays last week. They were suffering through a virus while I was presenting at the [Queensland Coastal Conference](http://event.icebergevents.com.au/qldcoastalconference2017). This is our 4th winter virus, it sucks.

We have been test riding cargo bikes, plan is to replace our car for most trips. 

Being pulled in a few directions at work. Trying to stay focused on a business development proposal along with figuring out how to finish the eReefs project on a high. 

Been helping out with [Ecoyarns](https://ecoyarns.com.au) most nights. We have brought in a few more suppliers and improved some backend things.

Haven't played much guitar or done much writing. 

Had enough yak shaving and dumped my Fedora desktop and collection of VMs for a 2012 MacBook Air. 

Just finished reading The [Luminaries](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333230-the-luminaries). Undecided about what to start next.
